# Rust Reverse Shell

This is just a simple reverse shell written in Rust. 

Still needs some more work on the error handling and addressing output racing, but it is functional.

## Usage

Modify the hardcoded IP and port in the `main.rs` file to your own IP and port. Then compile the program with `cargo build --release`. The compiled binary will be in the `target/release` directory.
